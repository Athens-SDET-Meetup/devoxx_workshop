##Evaluate Performance at Massive Scale workshop

Performance testing is the practice that helps us verify the reliability and performance of our applications.

Reliability has become paramount, and it is now a shared responsibility across all teams. Thus, performance testing has also shifted left, moving closer to frontend and backend developers.

Grafana k6 is a modern, open-source performance testing tool scriptable in Javascript. This interactive workshop provides participants with hands-on experience writing k6 performance tests, giving an overview of performance testing practices and various options for using k6 through practical examples with a demo app.Participants will use Docker compose to install locally a demo environment. 

##Objectives:
- Learn performance testing fundamentals and guidelines

- Implement different type of load tests and browser performance tests

- Model load tests in terms of throughput and concurrent users

- Implement advanced test scenarios

- Visualize performance results with OSS stack

- Verify SLO compliance in performance tests

- Extend k6 using extensions
